# Account Scraper

This app allows you find spotify premium and netflix accounts for free. It works by scraping pastebin.com, looking for combos in an email:password format and then tests each one using an automated browser.

## NOTE: The Spotify login form now uses Google reCAPTCHA and this app may not work if reCAPTCHA is blocking the form submission. A fix may come in the future.
